# MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training

## Overview
Microsoft Research's comprehensive study on building effective multimodal LLMs through systematic ablation studies and architectural analysis.

## Key Contributions
- **Data Composition**: Demonstrated optimal mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data for SOTA few-shot performance
- **Architecture Insights**: Image encoder and resolution are crucial; vision-language connector design has minimal impact
- **Model Scaling**: Successfully scaled to both dense (30B) and MoE (64B) variants
- **Multi-image Capabilities**: Enhanced in-context learning and multi-image reasoning abilities

## Implementation Example
```python
from mm1.model import MM1Model
from PIL import Image

def analyze_multiple_images(image_paths, query):
    # Initialize model
    model = MM1Model.from_pretrained('microsoft/mm1-30b')
    
    # Load images
    images = [Image.open(path) for path in image_paths]
    
    # Generate analysis
    response = model.generate(
        images=images,
        prompt=query,
        max_length=512,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response

# Usage example
images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg']
query = "Compare the architectural styles in these images."
result = analyze_multiple_images(images, query)
